What Are JavaScript Events?
An event is something that happens in the browser â€” like clicking a button, typing in a field, hovering over a box, submitting a form, etc.

You can write code that listens for these events and responds when they happen.

 Why Are Events Important?
Handle user interaction (click, scroll, submit)

Build dynamic behavior (form validation, show/hide content)

Automate UI actions (especially in Cypress)

 Types of Events (Most Used)
Event	When It Happens
click	When user clicks an element
mouseover	When mouse hovers over an element
mouseout	When mouse leaves an element
keydown	When a keyboard key is pressed
keyup	When key is released
change	When input/select value changes
submit	When a form is submitted
